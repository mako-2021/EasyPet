            Automatic Data Collection Technologies:<br></br>
            As you navigate through and interact with the Platforms, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. Some of this information may be linked to you personally. This information helps our Platforms function correctly, helps us understand the needs of our users and may be used for the other purposes set out in this privacy notice. Examples of this information include:
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            traffic data, location data, logs and other communication data related to the Platforms;
            data related to your use of the Platforms. This includes the pages you visit, the resources and services that you access; the time you spend on each page, the date and time of your visit, referring pages (pages you came from or go to) and statistical and other aggregated data derived from your use of the Platforms;
            information about your device, computer and network connection, including your IP address, operating system, hardware version and browser type;
            if you allow our Platforms to deliver content based on your location (for example by enabling this feature on your mobile device) we may collect location data (such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals) including for the automated delivery of relevant content and advertising to you.
            The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include log files, usage monitoring software and cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on a user's device that can identify the device you are working from. The cookie file gives us details such as your IP address, platform, browser and domain (whether you are accessing the Platform from NZ or elsewhere). We may use the information generated by cookies to personalise your experience on the Platforms, make it easier for you to navigate our Platforms, and improve your experience by storing your search, posting and other viewing and usage history, and your login details (if you choose) enabling you to use certain services as a registered user without having to log on each time. We may also use cookies to provide you with certain advertisements which may be of interest to you. If you disable cookies it may limit your access to some of the Platforms' content and features. You can choose to refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser and/or deleting them from your hard drive. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use our Platforms, but your experience may be affected.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            Other Tracking Technologies:<br></br>
            We advertise in a number of ways, including online through managed social media presences, and on other unaffiliated sites and mobile applications. To understand how our advertising campaigns are performing, and better understand the visitors to our Platform, we may collect certain information via our Platforms through our advertising service providers. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect information about our users, such as browser cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. The information we collect includes IP addresses, the number of page visits, pages viewed via our Platforms, search engine referrals, browsing activities over time and across other websites following your visit to our Platforms, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the websites and applications where we advertise.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            Third Parties, Advertising and third party links:<br></br>
            We may allow third-party companies to place ads and collect information when you visit our Platforms. This may include information that will not identify you personally (such as click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) and other information such as precise geo location and user device identification. This information is collected to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. The Platforms may also contain links to a variety of advertising and third party platforms and website sources. Some of these links may request or record information from users, use cookies or other methods to collect information from you. We have no control over the content or privacy notice practices of such sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of such sites before engaging in any activity with them.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            Social Media and APIs:<br></br>
            Our Platforms include features that are available through social media platforms (including Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat) and interactive programs. These features may collect your IP address, which pages you visit on our site, and how long for. If you're a member of a social media site, the interfaces may allow the social media site to connect your visits to this site with other personal information. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Platform. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy notice of the third party providing it and to the maximum extent permitted by law we accept no responsibility for the actions of those third parties.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            We may provide an application programming interface (API) to enable third party applications to interface with our Platforms. Some applications enable you to interact with us through the API in a way that requires you to log in. To do this, most of these applications will direct you through a process where you are able to let the application connect to your account.
            If you allow an application to connect to your account on our Platforms, including if you set up your account on our Platform using an API with a third party social media platform, that application will be able to access information that you can see when you are logged in tour Platforms. You should only allow applications you trust to access your account on our Platforms.
            If you set up your account on our Platforms using an API with a third party social media platform, you also consent to us obtaining and using your information from such platform.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            Mobile applications:<br></br>
            If you are using our mobile application, you acknowledge and accept that we can:
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
            choose to send you "Push Notifications". This is a message that pops up on a mobile device at any time. "Push Notification" preferences can be configured in the application's settings (you have the option to disable the notification when you first time open the application, and you can also go to your mobile phone setting to disable the notification); and
            access your device’s location function and collect, use and disclose this information as set out in this privacy notice (you can disable the share location setting if you don't want our Platforms to access your location).
